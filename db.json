			"description": "The Union LA x Air Jordan 4 Retro ‘Off Noir’ represents the follow-up effort to the duo’s highly coveted Air Jordan 1 collaboration from 2018. The updated design features a black suede upper with matching black mesh on the toe box and blue mesh around the collar. The semi-translucent structural wings are attached to molded red eyelets, matching the woven Air Jordan tag atop the padded tongue and Nike Air branding on the heel. The TPU wings are filled in, reminiscent of an original Tinker Hatfield sketch of the AJ4, while the AIR JORDAN tag usually found on the inside of the tongue conveys a unique look, like someone folded the tongue over to expose the inside tag. Finally, a 'UN/LA' tag on the side panel shows the Union heritage and a yellowed midsole conveys a vintage aesthetic.",
